# E2E test: a registration rewrite refreshes the sysroot of every subos that
# pins the rewritten version, not only the subos the command ran in (#586).
#
# The installer's effect-placement loop only ever wrote into the CURRENT
# subos. A registration rewrite (the recipe's install()/config() hooks
# re-run for a target@version that was already registered, and write
# DIFFERENT source paths for it) changed what a symlink in the sysroot
# should point at. Only the subos the command ran in got the update; every
# other subos pinning that exact version kept a symlink pointing at
# whatever the OLD registration named, and once that location is gone
# (this fixture's install() wipes its own install dir before writing the
# new layout -- a real reinstall-from-a-cleared-payload does the same),
# the link is left dangling. Measured on the maintainer's real home:
# freetype's links were valid in 4 subos and dangling in 3.
#
# The fixture makes the rewrite deterministic: install() picks one of two
# sub-layouts ("gen1"/"gen2") based on a marker file, and always wipes the
# WHOLE install dir first -- so the layout current before a registration
# rewrite is physically gone afterward, not merely unreferenced.
#
# Getting a SECOND subos to genuinely pin the version (not just install it
# independently) needs a workaround: once a payload is already installed
# anywhere, `xlings install` of the same target@version takes a shortcut
# straight to activation (`xvm cmd_use`) instead of re-running the recipe --
# and that activation refuses because the target was never in THIS subos's
# own installed[] set, so plain sequential `install` calls in two subos
# never both end up pinning the payload through the CLI alone. This is a
# separate, pre-existing gap (not #586), so the test works around it by
# seeding `other`'s installed[] directly, the same way other e2e fixtures
# seed state a code path won't produce for them, then calling `xlings use`
# to materialize+activate for real. See task-7-report.md for the write-up.
#
# For the same reason, plain `remove` + `install` (the shape #586 was
# literally filed against) does not by itself retrigger the recipe once
# another subos genuinely pins the version: `remove` correctly detaches
# only the current subos and keeps the shared payload ("payload kept --
# still used by other"), and the payload still being on disk means the
# next `install` takes that same broken shortcut instead of re-running
# config(). The test clears the shared payload directory after `remove` to
# force the reinstall through -- a stand-in for the payload having gone
# missing or been GC'd, which is a realistic way a real registration
# rewrite gets triggered.
#
# Scenarios:
#   1. install in `default`; bootstrap `other` to genuinely pin the same
#      version too; `bystander` gets nothing. Both installed subos read
#      back gen1.
#   2. flip the marker; in `default` only: `remove` (detach-only, since
#      `other` still pins it) + clear the shared payload + `install` again
#      -> a registration rewrite to gen2.
#   3. `other`'s sysroot must have followed the rewrite to gen2, with no
#      dangling symlink left behind.
#   4. `bystander`, which never had the package, must still have none --
#      the refresh must not push it into a subos that never asked for it.

# `find_subos_pinning_version` (profile.cpp) is built on `load_subos_
# snapshots`, which -- by design, per its own doc comment -- SKIPS a subos
# whose `.xlings.json` fails to parse: "a subos whose config a user
# hand-edited into invalid JSON must not take down an unrelated `remove`".
# That means a subos with a broken state file is never even NAMED as
# pinning anything, so it cannot reach the `log::warn` this review added --
# confirmed empirically (built both binaries, corrupted `other`'s file
# before a registration rewrite: the added-for-this-review warn line does
# not fire, and `remove`'s own pre-existing "still referenced" check is
# blind to it the same way, so `remove` did a full removal instead of a
# detach). Widening that shared scan to surface unreadable files would
# undo the exact guarantee its doc comment describes protecting, for a
# second, unrelated caller (`xlings remove`'s pinned-by reporting) -- out
# of scope for this fix, and the kind of change that trades one silent
# failure for a different one.
#
# So this scenario tests what IS true and IS the point of "Required" in
# the review even though the specific warn line is unreachable through
# this path today: a broken subos must not block, corrupt, or widen the
# blast radius of a registration rewrite happening elsewhere. `other` is
# left exactly as it was (a stale/dangling link, silently, same as any
# other command that consults `find_subos_pinning_version` today) while
# `default` still gets refreshed correctly and `bystander` stays untouched.
