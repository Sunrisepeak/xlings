// module owns WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. The commands are injected, so the whole

// this subos at all; and when the payload is already missing, which is
// exactly the state a broken-payload repair starts from. In every one of
// those the record survives, the install that follows fails against the same
// record that made R2 fail, and R3 reports the package REMOVED.

// no state file access by design. A caller that supplies nothing keeps the old

// `remove --force` bypasses `cmd_remove`'s own reverse-dependency guard by

// previous one failed:
//
//   R2 re-register  `xlings install <pkg>@<ver> -y`
//                   Cheap and the usual answer. The installer's xvm-DB
//                   shortcut checks the payload on disk first, so with the
//                   payload intact this re-runs config() only -- no download
//                   -- and that is exactly what converts a 0.4.69 record into
//                   the current format.
//
//                   Skipped entirely for RepairKind::SweptPayload: that
//                   payload already passes the same shortcut (it IS on
//                   disk, and the database agrees), so R2 would report
//                   "healed" without removing what a sweep left beside it.
//
//   R3 reinstall    `xlings remove …` then `xlings install …`
//                   For the case R2 cannot reach: a record the registration
//                   layer REFUSES to overwrite (xvm-legacy-payload-mismatch).
//                   Destructive, gated on `reinstallable`, and reported
//                   specially when it removes successfully and then fails to
//                   install -- that is the one outcome that leaves the user
//                   worse off than before, and it must never be silent.
//
//                   `removalDone` is what makes "removes successfully" mean
//                   the record is gone rather than the command exited 0. See
//                   RemovalVerifier: on a multi-subos home those are different
//                   statements, and reporting REMOVED for a version that is
//                   still installed is a worse lie than any failure message.
