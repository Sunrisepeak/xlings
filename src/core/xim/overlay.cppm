// The local index used to be a write-only drawer: `config --add-xpkg` copied
// a recipe in, and nothing after that could say what was in there, where it
// came from, or whether the synced index had already caught up with it. On
// the maintainer's own machine 159 recipes had accumulated this way, 157 of
// them byte-identical to what `xim` now ships — every one of them a bare
// name that resolves ambiguously and prints a namespace-priority warning,
// with no command to find out why or clean it up.
//
// This module gives the overlay a provenance record (`.overlay.json`, one
// entry per recipe: where it came from, when, and what it looked like at
// add time) and a status question that can be asked of any entry against
// the synced index it shadows:
//
//   Unique      no same-named recipe in any non-local repo
//   Identical   byte-identical to a same-named upstream recipe — the index
//               has caught up; safe to garbage-collect
//   Modified    an upstream recipe with the same name exists, differs in
//               bytes, and isn't simply a newer upstream release
//   Behind      upstream declares a newer version than this entry recorded
//
// `upstream_candidates` and `gc_identical` each come in two shapes: the
// plain one answers from the real index_repos this process has loaded
// (`Config::global_index_repos()` + discovered sub-repos), and the
// `std::span<const RepoDir>` overload takes an injected list instead — so a
// unit test can build a fake "upstream" directory without a real home.
//
// `.overlay.json` only exists from this module onward, so on its own it
// answers "what has been added SINCE this module shipped" — every one of
// the 159 recipes on a real machine, added by years of earlier `xlings`
// builds, has no entry there at all. `load_with_files` is the fix: it
// merges `.overlay.json` with a scan of `pkgs/*/*.lua` and synthesizes an
// entry for anything not already tracked, so `--list-xpkg`, `--clear-xpkg`
// and `xlings update`'s GC see the whole overlay, not just what post-dates
// this feature.
